## Handle Multiple Issues

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is specifically for open source projects, where contributors are allowed to work on only 1 issue at a time.

With this GitHub workflow, you can automate tasks whenever an author creates multiple open issues. More details are below.

### Use cases

- The workflow can comment which open issues are already created by the author.
- You can add your own comment message
- You can add a custom label to add whenever there is open issues by the same author
- You can close the issue (previous issues won't be affected) and just the current issue will be closed

---
