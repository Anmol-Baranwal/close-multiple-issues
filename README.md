## Handle Multiple Issues

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This GitHub workflow is designed for open source projects where users are allowed to create only one issue at a time.

With this GitHub workflow, you can automate tasks whenever an author creates multiple open issues.

### Use cases

- The workflow can comment the issues that are already created by the author which are currently in the open state.
- You can add your own comment message (even multiline) in the issue.
- Add a custom label on the issue.
- Optionally, you can also close the issue (previous issues won't be affected), and only the current issue will be closed.

---

### Getting Started

- For custom configuration in-depth, you can check [examples](#examples).

```yml
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - reopened
      - opened
jobs:
  handle-multiple-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Handle Multiple Issues
        uses: Anmol-Baranwal/handle-multiple-issues@main
        with:
          label: "multiple issues" #default
          close: false  #default
          issueNumber: true  #default is false
          gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this is mandatory
```

---

### Inputs

Various inputs are defined to let you configure the action:

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `gh-token` | The GitHub token for authentication | N/A |
| `label` | A label to add if the conditions are fulfilled | `'multiple issues'` |
| `comment` | A message to comment on the issue | `''` |
| `close` | This will close the issue if set to true | `'false'` |
| `issueNumber` | This will comment all the previous issues that are created by the author | `'potential-duplicate'` |

<br>

The four Combinations that you can use with comment and issueNumber:

> Suppose, a user has created `#1`, `#2` which are currently open and we have now included this workflow. Now suppose he creates the `#3` issue.

> You can see the [examples](#examples) for better clarity.

| issueNumber | comment | Purpose | Message by Bot |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| `true` |  | To mention issue number with the default message | `#2, #1 is already opened by you` |
| `true` | `custom_message` | To mention issue number with a custom message | `#2, #1 custom_message` |
| `false` | `custom_message` | Custom message without mentioning issue | `custom_message` |
| `false` |  | Nothing is mentioned; only the label is added as per the workflow | |
